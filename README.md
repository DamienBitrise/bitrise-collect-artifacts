# bitrise-collect-artifacts

Bitrise Collect Artifacts step.

This step collects build artifacts from all builds started using the Bitrise Start Build step (https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-build-router-start)

This step will use the Bitrise API (https://api-docs.bitrise.io/#/) to download the build artifacts from each of the build slugs set in the `$ROUTER_STARTED_BUILD_SLUGS` output generated by the Bitrise Start Build step.

Each build artifact can be saved into a custom path.
